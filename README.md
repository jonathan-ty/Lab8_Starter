### Graceful Degradation 

How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

*Graceful degradation and service workers are related because it seeks to solve the lower levels with grace, namely resiliency. A web app that may have its max technologies implemented will need to consider whether it can function and perform just as well when things go wrong in its application. For example, a problem that could arise is if the web application cannot access the network or is offline. Service workers help by referencing previous network calls that were made when it web app wasn't online to be stored in the cache to be used offline.*
